Signal Catalog
==============

.. include:: _static/signal_list.txt


This catalog contains a set of test signals from different fields in biology.
Loading a signal is supported for single-channel signals by  :func:`lmlib.utils.generator.load_single_channel` or
for multi-channel signals by  :func:`lmlib.utils.generator.load_multi_channel`.
See also :ref:`lmlib_single_multi_channel`.

Note
----
This overview is generated automatically,
listing all available sample signals located in the directory ``lmlib/utils/data``.
Any new signals added to this directory in the  ``.csv`` format,
will also show up in this catalog.
The file names should follow the following convention:

*<TYPE>_<DESCRIPTION>_<nCH>_<xxxs>_<FSyyyyyHZ>.csv*

with

| *<TYPE>* : Singal source, e.g., ECG, EMG, etc.
| *<DESCRIPTION>* : Signal description such as "sinus_rhythm"
| *<nCH>*: number of channels, e.g., "1CH", "32CH", etc.
| *<xxxxs>* : signal length in seconds, e.g., "10.3s"
| *<FSyyyyHZ>*: sampling frequency, e.g., "FS1000HZ" for 1kHz sampling.




The catalog is generated by the script ``examples/test_examples/_load_csv_filtes_and_create_img``.
